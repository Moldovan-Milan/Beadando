# This is my wpf application project!

This is a simple **WPF** application that similar to a **webshop**.
The user can:
- View the product, add it to the basket and order it
-   See the reviews (just look, writing doesn't work yet)
- Sort products by categories

## How to use it?
First, a **database** named **moldovan_milan_beadando_db** must be created. Text alignment is **utf8_hungarian_ci**.
Then import the **moldovan_milan_beadando_db.sql** file from the database folder.  Then run **MoldovanMilanBeadando.exe** file. The database contains a few pre-created user accounts.
The **admin account**:

- username: admin
- password: admin

Two standard user accounts:

- username: **teszt** password: **teszt**
- username: **valaki** password **valaki**

If you want to create an account, press the register button.

### What can the admin do?
- Admin can create new product. Uploading the product image does not work yet, but all other parameters do. 
- Able to edit existing products

## Future plans
I would like to add a few functions to the application:

- Give the user the ability to write reviews
- Make a better GUI
- Add some new admin options:
	 - View orders
	 - Uploading product images
- Add a web interface and use it as an admin interface
